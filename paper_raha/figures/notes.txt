Questions

* I'd like to thank you for all you time in patience. I was thinking the acknowledgments section would be the place to do that, but is that weird because you're an author. Usually those things start "The authors would like to thank.."

* Should I list some of the people I would like to thank at the Verlab in Brazil?

* Am I over thinking this? Should it just be to acknowledge the sandia PO and the NSF grant?

* Speaking of. Should I be putting Dr. Fierro name on this? I am grateful for the NSF grant.

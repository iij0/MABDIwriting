\caption{Viewpoint coordinates to real world coordinates analysis. Viewpoint coordinates are obtained when a mesh is rendered into a render window, and can be transformed to real-world coordinates using the transformation matrix of the camera. Noise is added in simulation to the viewpoint coordinates. This graph shows the effect of that noise in real-world coordinates.}

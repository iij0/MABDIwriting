Results of all experimental runs. For each run: Top-left is the global mesh,
top-middle is the novel surface, top-right is the number of elements in the
global mesh, bottom-left what we actually saw, bottom-middle what we expected to
see, bottom-left threshold of the difference between expected and actual.

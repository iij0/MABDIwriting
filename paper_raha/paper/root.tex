% introspection
% classification
% using mesh methods

The goal of this work is to design a method which can create a reliable
mesh representation of the environment from sequential registered noisy
point cloud data sets. We will name this method MABDI which stands for Mesh
Adaptation Based on the Depth Image. The method must be computationally
feasible for online applications and have a low memory requirement. In
addition, the method must update the representation when new measurements of
revisited parts of the environment are made.

\end{abstract}

\input{introduction}
% set up what environmental mapping is, what a mesh is
% design goals of the system

% \input{related_works}
% show many mesh based algorithms are black box
% systems capable of introspection such as kinectfusion rely on volumetric
% representation and are computationally and memory expensive

% \input{approach}
% How Mabdi works, describe the algorithm
% How Mabdi is implemented

% \input{experimental_setup}
% describe the simulation environment
% maybe determine speed of walker
% discuss noise

% \input{results}
% Results of the runs
% Definitely talk about how adding a bunny worked well

% \input{conclusion}
% discuss difficulty with noise
% how to expand to deal with object deletion

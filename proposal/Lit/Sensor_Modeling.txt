Accuracy analysis of kinect depth data (2011) ISPRS workshop laser scanning
 University of Twente; Netherlands - K. Khoshelham
- Very related to ICRA paper
- Did tests for a range of 0 to 5m. 
- Gave a very good theoritical propagation of the variance in the disparity differences to the variance in depth
- Showed that theoritcally the variance of the measurments should proportional to the square root of the distance 
- Conducted a camera calibration
- Aligned point cloud from Kinect to high end laser to try and determine systematic noise for X,Y,Z 
- Plane-fitting test on door. Fit 2nd degree polynomial to errors on door. 

3D with Kinect (2011) 2011 IEEE International Conference on Computer Vision Workshops (ICCV Workshops)
 Czech Technical University in Prague; Dept. of Cybernetics - Jan Smisek, Michal Jancosek, and Tomas Pejdla
- Showed a very complete calibration procedure for the Kinect starting from a theoritcal framework
- Introduced a method to try and "learn" an additional correction procedure for unmodeled noise
- Combined

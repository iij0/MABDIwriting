- Provide a large dataset containing RGB-D image sequences (from a Kinect), the ground-truth camera trajectories, and the accelerometer data from the Kinect. The data was taken at 30Hz and a resolution of 640x480 (like it should be)
- Give references to SLAM history in robotics and computer-vision. Should be worth going through them. 
- Mention only 2 works in the area I’m interested in but they are expecting a boom. Yikes.
- They moved in a typical office environment. Not many large blank and textureless surfaces are seen (in my opinion from a picture in the paper)
- Data was recorded as a ROS bag file. ROS is catching on. 
- They acquired 50Gb of data. Wow
- The also propose a metric to grade future algorithms. Basically the difference of the calculated and observed position for all frames.

- Basically saying that they added to their prior data set with more trajectories 
- Give a few more metrics for evaluation

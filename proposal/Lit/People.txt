Open Source Robotics Foundation (OSRF) - An organization that was pretty much unheard of until DARPA recently awarded them with a contract to produce the a standard simulation environment for its Humanoid Challenge. Now it’s being populated with some very big names.

The Droid Works - A very small start up company by Helen Greiner (who is also a co-founder of iRobot). The Droid Works was awarded a Small Business Innovation Research grant by NSF to create technologies that will allow small UAVs to navigate inside buildings. 

Robotics Technology Consortium (RTC) -  A non-profit organization established to speed the creation and deployment of ground robotics technology.

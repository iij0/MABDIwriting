First experiment

7.1.1 Static scene, static object, static sensor mesh validation
- Simulate data take from known environment. 
 - An object on a table
 - Generate simulated sensor data from a known view in the environment
- Apply adaptive mesh technique
 - Create initial mesh from points that are close to each other with delaunay triangulation
 - Simulate the acquisition of new data
 - Determine the resultant forces on each node
 - Evolve the mesh according to F=ma
- Compare quality of mesh by evaluating error of mesh to known truth
- Optimize adaptive mesh parameters

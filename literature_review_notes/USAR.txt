- Good source to state they found better efficiency when using a representation they call a virtual 3D map
- It "reduced operator workload and navigational error" 
- Also lower bandwidth requirements. (assuming the map is being built onboard) 

Effective user interface design for rescue robotics (Kadous et al. 2006) t - Cited 48
 University of New South Wales - M. Waleed Kadous, Raymond Ka-Man Sheh, Claude Sammut 
- Says the best user interface designs are modeled after first-person-shooters like Quake and Half-Life

 University of Massachusetts - Holly Yanco
- Had 4 groups do an exploration task using 4 different UI for a robot. 
- They found people had problems when they could not easily visualize the state of the robot in the environment 
- Divided HRI into 5 components. We are interested in Human-robot HRI which they define as "the understanding that the humans have of the locations, identities, activities, status and surroundings of the robots. 

Human-robot interactions during the robot-assisted urban search and rescue response at the World Trade Center (Jasper and Murphy 2003) t - Cited 444
 University of South Florida - Jennifer Casper, Robin Roberson Murphy
- Looked at the World Trade Center tragedy as a case study in HRI
- Video and audio was the only info sent to operators and this was disorientating 
- "Concentrate on researching how to extract and represent state of the robot and state of what has been seen to compliment existing work in state of the world."

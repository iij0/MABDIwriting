This work has presented a novel methodology for generating a measurement noise
model for Kinect-style sensors.  Classical work in sensor modeling has defined
the uncertainty to be constant for all measurements. For many depth sensors,
especially those like Kinect, this constant assumption simply isn't true. In
recent work ad hoc models have been created to be more realistic. Our method
generates sensor models from a thorough stochastic analysis of a large data
set. We give our generated model and compare the results with a validation set.
Our method is better than an ad hoc guess, however a model may need to be
generated for a specific sensor depending on the needs of the algorithm it will
be used for. We have made it easy to generate a model for your own sensor by
making the code freely available. In future work we intend to improve our model
by taking into account the error induced by lens distortion. Additionally, we
would like to evaluate our model with existing SLAM algorithms.

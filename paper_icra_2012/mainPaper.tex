\begin{abstract}

% Kinect-style RGB-D sensors have provided an economical depth sensing
% technology. Since measurements from these sensors are noisy, most algorithms
% which use this technology require an underlying model to describe the
% uncertainty in the measurements. Models, up until now, have been ad hoc. This
% work will develop a measurement noise model based on thorough statistical
% analysis of a large data set. In this paper, we describe our entire methodology
% and give the generated model. Also, we validate our model with two different
% sensors. Finally, our implementation is freely available online.

% What did we do? Why? To whom is it going to be useful?

% We present an approximate measurement noise model for the Kinect sensor by using frames
% captured from a large flat wall. This work aims to provide the reader with a
% more detailed noise description than the models currently available on the
% literature. Such models are of crucial importance for probabilistic algorithms
% in the robotics field, such as stochastic environmental mapping and Monte Carlo
% Localization frameworks.

% This work looks to develop an error model for the Microsoft Kinect sensor for
% use in further research in the field of computer vision. The model takes into
% account both the distance and orientation the object within the field of
% measurement. Using data collected experimentally a 3D-surface was generated
% using the distance, orientation, and a sensor reliability weight. This sensor
% reliability weight can then be used as a means to minimize the effects of
% outliers and error in generating point cloud data using the Microsoft Kinect.

% The availability of economical, depth-based sensing technology, such as the
% Microsoft Kinect, has been a major factor in the recent advance of robotics.
% However, measurements made by these inexpensive sensors are often quite noisy .
% Current algorithms hoping to make use of this data require underlying models to
% describe this uncertainty.  This work looks to improve on the ad hoc models
% typically used by developing a statistical model based on the analysis of a
% significantly large data set. In this paper, the process used in gathering a
% representative data set for the Kinect and the statistical methodology used in
% generating a sensor model is described.  A representative function of sensor
% noise based on inputs of distance and angle of incident is presented and further
% validated with two additional data sets generated by different sensors.  The
% full implementation of this work is freely available online.

Kinect-style RGB-D sensors have provided an economical depth sensing technology.
However, measurements made with these sensors contain significant noise.  This
work aims to develop a measurement noise model for the depth values acquired
from Kinect-style sensors using a statistical analysis of a large real-world
data set.  We present the methods used for collecting a data set as well as a
summary of the statistical analysis performed to obtain a sensor model using a
Kinect sensor. Our generated model shows that uncertainty is strongly influenced
by distance and weakly influenced by incident angle. A verification of our model
was performed using a second Kinect and an ASUS Xtion PRO. The results show our
model would be a good approximation for other Kinect-style RGB-D sensors, but
that a model may need to be generated for a specific sensor to obtain higher
accuracy. Additionally, our implementation is freely available online.

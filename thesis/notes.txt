Questions:
* \techrepnum{} - thesis.tex - What number do I put here?

* I do have one question. Basically: What is the difference between "unmeereport.cls" and "eeceTR.cls?" In the documentation I see no reference to "eeceTR.cls." Running diff on "unmeereport.cls" and "eeceTR.cls" I see minor changes.
* My main concern, which of these style files should I use? If the answer is "eeceTR.cls" perhaps you should update the initial README.txt?

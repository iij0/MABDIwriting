\begin{frame}{Conclusion} % __________________________________________________________
  \begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item The MABDI algorithm runs at around 2Hz on a consumer grade laptop with
    an Intel i7 processor.
    \item MABDI's algorithmic design identifies redundant information and removes it
    \emph{before} it is added to the global mesh.
    \item MABDI does this by leveraging the difference between what we are
    actually seeing and what we expect to see.
    \item MABDI can work in conjunction with any current mesh-based surface
    reconstruction algorithms, and can be thought of as a general means to
    provide introspection to those types of reconstruction methods.
  \end{itemize}

  \note<1->{\begin{itemize}
    \item Currently MABDI is only designed to handle object addition
    \item can be extended to handle both object addition and removal
    \item allowing ability to handle highly dynamic environments
  \end{itemize}}

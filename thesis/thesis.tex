\begin{abstract}
  Many robotic applications, especially those whose goal is to aid or assist
  through human-robot interaction, utilize a rich map of the world for reasoning
  tasks such as collision detection, path planning, or object recognition. Such
  a map, and the method used to produce it, must take into consideration
  real-world constraints. Most mesh-based mapping algorithms resemble a ``black
  box'' and do not provide a mechanism to close the loop and make decisions
  about the incoming information. MABDI leverages the global mesh by finding the
  difference between what we expect to see and what we are actually seeing, and
  using this to classify the incoming measurements as novel or not. This allows
  the surface reconstruction method to be run only on data that has not yet been
  represented in the global mesh. The result is an algorithm that becomes
  computationally inexpensive once the environment is known, but still can
  incorporate new objects into the model.

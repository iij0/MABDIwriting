\begin{abstract}
  Many robotic applications, especially those whose goal is to aid or assist
  through human-robot interaction, utilize a rich map of the world for reasoning
  tasks such as collision detection, path planning, or object recognition. Such
  map, and the method used to produce it, must take into consideration real-world
  constraints. Most mesh-based mapping algorithms resemble a ``black box'' and do
  not provide a mechanism to close the loop and make decisions about the
  incoming information. MABDI leverages the global mesh by finding the difference
  between what we expect to see and what we are actually seeing, and using this to
  classify the incoming measurements as novel or not. This allows the surface
  reconstruction method to be run only on data that has not yet been represented in
  the global mesh. The result is an algorithm that becomes computationally
  inexpensive once the environment is known, but can also react to new objects.
